# ðŸ”— API Integration Basics

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) lets systems talk to each other. In onboarding, it's how partners connect their platform to ours.

## Key Concepts
- **Endpoints**: URLs where the data lives
- **Authentication**: API keys or OAuth
- **Payload**: Data sent in a request (usually JSON)
- **Response Codes**: 200 (OK), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found)

## Tools You Can Use
- **Postman** for testing
- **Swagger** for documentation
- **Webhook.site** for dummy testing
